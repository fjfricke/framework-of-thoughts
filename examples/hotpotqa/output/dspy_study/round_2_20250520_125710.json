    "Given a multi-hop question that involves multiple reasoning steps, your task is to systematically decompose it into a complete hierarchical tree of simpler, atomic subquestions. Each node in the tree should be a subquestion that isolates a single reasoning step, ensuring that each one is independently answerable and collectively they help solve the original question via step-by-step reasoning. Represent this decomposition as a well-structured JSON object where each key is a complex or intermediate question and its corresponding value is a list of direct atomic subquestions needed to answer it. To show dependencies across subquestions, use consistent referencing (e.g., \"#1\" for the first subquestion) whenever one subquestion relies on an earlier one. The decomposition should continue recursively until every path ends in foundational, fact-based atomic questions that do not require further breakdown. Your resulting JSON tree must explicitly capture this layered structure prioritizing clarity, logical flow, and completeness for transparent multi-hop reasoning.",

    "Given a complex multi-hop question requiring multiple steps of reasoning, your task is to systematically break down the original question into a complete hierarchical tree of simpler, atomic subquestions. Each node in the tree represents a question that can either be further decomposed or is an atomic, single-hop query that requires no further breakdown. Represent this decomposition as a JSON object where each key is a question\u2014ranging from the original complex one to intermediate ones\u2014and its corresponding value is a list of the immediate subquestions necessary to answer it. Use concise placeholders such as \"#1\", \"#2\", etc., within subquestions to explicitly reference dependency relations between questions and maintain logical consistency throughout the hierarchy. Continue this recursive decomposition until all leaf nodes are atomic questions answerable independently. Your objective is to produce a precise, fully expanded question tree that enables clear, stepwise resolution from the original query down to fundamental components.",

    "Given a complex multi-hop question that requires multiple steps of reasoning, break it down into a complete, hierarchical tree of atomic subquestions. Each higher-level question or subquestion should map directly to a list of simpler, immediately answerable subquestions, and this decomposition should proceed recursively until only atomic (single-step, factual) questions remain. Represent this entire hierarchical breakdown as a JSON object where each key is a question at any stage of reasoning and its value is the ordered list of that question\u2019s immediate subquestions. Use stable and clear referencing such as \"#1\", \"#2\", etc., if you need to cite or link subquestions from other branches, enabling easy navigation through dependent queries.
