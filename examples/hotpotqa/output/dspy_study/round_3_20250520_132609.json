    "Your task is to take a complex multi-hop question requiring multiple reasoning steps and decompose it into a clear, comprehensive hierarchical tree of simpler atomic subquestions. The goal is to break down each complex or intermediate question into a list of directly related, simpler subquestions whose answers are necessary to solve it. Continue this decomposition recursively until all leaf nodes in the tree are foundational, standalone atomic questions that require no further breakdown and are independently answerable.\n\nRepresent the entire decomposition as a well-structured JSON object where:\n- Each key is a complex or intermediate question at any level of the hierarchy.\n- Each value is a list of its direct subquestions.\n- Use explicit hierarchical nesting built into the JSON structure.\n- When referencing prior subquestions to show dependencies, use clear, uniquely identifiable tags (for example, \"#1\", \"#2\"), consistently applying them across the tree.\n\nEnsure the final JSON organizes multi-hop reasoning steps into a logically flowing and easy-to-follow chain, enabling a step-by-step path from questions at the root down to atomic subquestions at the leaves. Emphasize clarity, completeness, and independence of atomic questions to map the end-to-end reasoning process transparently.",

    "Given a complex multi-hop question that involves multiple layers of reasoning, your task is to meticulously break it down into a hierarchical tree of simpler, atomic subquestions. Structure the decomposition as a well-formed JSON object where each key is a subquestion\u2014ranging from the original complex question at the root through intermediate subquestions down to foundational, fact-based atomic questions\u2014and each value is a list of its direct, logically connected subquestions necessary to answer it. Ensure that each atomic subquestion isolates a single reasoning step and is independently answerable without further breakdown. When dependencies arise, refer to subquestions clearly and consistently with unique human-readable labels such as \"#1,\" \"#2,\" etc. Recursively perform this decomposition until every branch concludes with indivisible atomic subquestions that collectively provide a transparent, stepwise path for obtaining the final answer to the original multi-hop question. Prioritize clarity, logical coherence, and completeness to facilitate explicit incremental reasoning through the entire question.",

    "You are presented with a complex, multi-hop question that requires careful multi-step reasoning. Your task is to iteratively and recursively break down this original question into a comprehensive and fully detailed hierarchical tree of simpler, atomic subquestions. Each node in this tree corresponds to a specific subquestion that encapsulates a single minimal reasoning step, which is independently answerable without further decomposition. To accurately capture dependencies among the subquestions, assign unique identifiers (like \"#1\", \"#2\" etc.) and reference them consistently wherever needed. Represent this entire decomposition as a well-structured JSON object in which each key is a complex or intermediate question and the corresponding value is a list of its immediate atomic subquestions that are required to answer it. Continue the breakdown until each branching path terminates in foundational fact-based subquestions that do not require further elaboration. The resulting JSON decomposition should constitute a clear, logically coherent, and exhaustive roadmap illustrating the step-by-step logical process by which the original multi-hop question can be answered, enabling full transparency and interpretability. Prioritize clarity, precision, and comprehensive reasoning over brevity.",
