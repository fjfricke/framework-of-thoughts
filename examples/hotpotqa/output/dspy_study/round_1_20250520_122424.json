    "Given a complex multi-hop question, decompose it into a hierarchical tree structure of simpler atomic subquestions. Each complex question should map to a list of immediate, logically linked subquestions whose answers collectively construct the response to the original question. Use this approach recursively so that subquestions may themselves be broken down further, ultimately reaching independently answerable atomic queries. Represent the decomposition as a JSON object, where keys are questions at any level, and values are lists of their direct subquestions. Employ references like \"#1\" to indicate upstream questions by position if necessary. The structure should enable step-by-step reasoning to answer the original multi-hop question through progressively simpler components.",

    "You are given a multi-hop question that requires several reasoning steps. Your task is to decompose it into a hierarchical tree of atomic (single-hop) subquestions that clarify each reasoning stage. Each node in the tree is a subquestion that simplifies part of the original question. The format should be a JSON object where keys are questions and values are lists of their direct subquestions, referencing other subquestions where appropriate using placeholders like #1 for the first subquestion. This decomposition should break down the main question from complex to simpler parts until all are basic factual questions.",

    "You are given a complex multi-hop question that requires breaking down into simpler subquestions that connect logically to solve the original query step-by-step. Your task is to create a detailed hierarchical decomposition represented as a tree structure in JSON format. Each entry in the dictionary must have the original complex question or intermediate subquestion as the key, and the value is a list of its direct atomic subquestions required to answer it. If a subquestion references another subquestion, refer to that question with a unique identifier (like `#1`) to signify the dependency. Produce the full tree covering all necessary decomposition steps until only atomic (indivisible) questions remain, enabling clear incremental reasoning towards the final answer.",
